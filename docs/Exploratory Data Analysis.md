## Purpose

- Used to identify patterns which can be observed by naked eye


## Types of analysis

- Univariate - raw data info
- Bivariate - link between label and dependent variable
- Mulivariate - link between mltiple variables - genrally dimensionality reduction is used and visualised in 2D or 3D

## Examples of analysis from the notebooks in the site

- Univariate - PIMA data (logistic regression): We plot each variable of the data and observe right skewed data. The outliers drag the regression line far so we clean up the data to reduce outliers.
- Bivariate - linear regression data: We plot relationship between income, age and experience and observe no clear reationship between age and income. So we go ahead and work with experience and income columns.

### Will keep on updating as we proceed

## Univariate analysis

### Numerical Data

- Histograms: Observe data skew and outliers
- Distplot: Histogram with a probability distribution curve
- Boxplot: Used to identify mean, median. Can also help in identifying skew

### Categorical Data

- Count Plot: Count the values belonging to each category
- Pie Chart: Helps visually identify percentage of categorical data

## Multivariate Analysis

- Scatter Plot: Identify relationships
- Bar plot: Identify data rellationships
